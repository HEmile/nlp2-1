\noindent {\bf Theoretical description: } 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Did students understand the problem?
	\item Did students present the solution correctly?
	\item This includes ``clarity'', consistent use of mathematical notation
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf Empirical evaluation: } 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Did students correctly reproduce all evaluation scenarios we proposed?
	\item This includes all experimental aspects: reproducibility, discussion.
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf Writing style: } 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is the writing style adequate (consider a workshop-style submission)?
	\item This includes all aspects of presentation: readable tables, intuitive plots, illustrations, examples.
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf Extra: } 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Did students addressed the extra challenges?
\end{itemize}
