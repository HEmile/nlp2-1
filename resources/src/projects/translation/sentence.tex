A source sentence can be seen as a trivial linear finite-state acceptor whose arcs are labelled with the words in original order. Consider the example \texttt{the black dog}, Figure \ref{fig:src} illustrates one way to encode it as a transducer.\footnote{Obviously, there are different ways to do so. I chose to encode it as a transducer from 0-based input positions to source words because the positions will turn out to be useful when we are interested in retrieving the alignment between source and target after translation.}

Table \ref{tab:task1} summarises the task. 

\begin{table}[h]\centering
\begin{tabular}{l p{12cm}}
\textsc{Task}   &  encode source sentences as transducers \\
\textsc{Input}  &  first 100 English sentences in \texttt{dev.en} \\
\textsc{Output} &  one transducers for each sentence\\
\textsc{Submit} & nothing to submit here\\
\textsc{Report} & add a graphical illustration for one example from \texttt{dev.en} \\
