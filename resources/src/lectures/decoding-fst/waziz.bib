	Review = {Germann et al. (2004) model error: the highest scoring hypothesis leads to an incorrect translation (function of the parameterisation) search error: an approximate search technique causes the decoder to select a translation other than the optimum (function of the search) This paper introduces the *induction error*: which occurs when the search space does not contain the target sentence at all (function of the ruleset) INDUCTION ERROR Translation option limit (tol) is an important component of "heuristic pruning" because it controls the complexity of the search space. Disregarding reordering the complexity of the search is O(n^tol) where n is the number of spans in the source. Traditionally tol is set to 20 and the authors show that this accounts for 93.8% of the complete ruleset and that only 0.1% of the input spans have more than 20 translation options. The authors hypothesise and support empirically that increasing tol gives the decoder a larger vocabulary which in turn decrease the induction error. SIMILARITY BETWEEN PB AND HIERO SEARCH SPACES (1) hierarchical models translate discontiguous groups of words as a unit / PB models don't (2) PB reordering is arbitrary within the distortion limit / hierarchical models require some lexical evidence for movement, resorting to monote translation otherwise (3) both models can indirectly account for word deletion in the context of phrases, but hiero models can delete words using nonlocal context due to its use of discountiguous phrases The authors want to investigate whether the difference in their genertive stories are responsible for differences in performance (it's usual to assume the answer to this question "yes"). FINDINGS with French-English 1) induction error phrase-based * from tol=20 to tol=50 for all dl >= 6 there is more than 30% increase in reachability (inverse of induction error), with unbounded tol reachability still increases (highest increases between tol=20 and tol=200). * higher distortion limit also increases reachability (even for French-English) hiero with pattern matching * increasing the number of samples drawn from training data to perform rule extraction shows a similar trend of that of tol in PBSMT The authors also find that the options made reachable by increasing tol from 20 to 50 with dl=10 are to a considerable extent based on translation options which are meaningful, rather than an artifact of unreliable alignment points. 2) overlap between PB and Hiero Reminder) tightness constraint: rules based on unaligned words at the edges of spans (source or target) are disallowed The authors force Hiero and PB to produce each other's 1-best translation. They find that their high-probability region seem to largely overlap (not sure why they call it high-probability region --- maybe because it survives pruning). PB is more successful in recovering Hiero's best translation if the tightness contraint is loosened. WA: I have the impression they test "reachability" only, so it puzzles me the statement "1-best regions of both systems are nearly identical". The authors find that PB fails at reaching Hiero's 1-best due to the structural differences (1) and (3). PB is can emulate some of Hiero's behaviour when unaligned words at the edges of phrases are allowed (still in this experiment dl=10 is a quite large distortion limit compared to typical settings). Hiero is very successful in reaching PB's 1-best which means that requiring lexical evidence (2) is not a large obstacle for Hiero models. OPEN QUESTIONS * use the long tail is challenging due to complexity * beyon exact match of references * more precise mechanisms to measure search space overlap -- other than 1-best region},

	Abstractnote = {Although the problem of determining the minimum cost path through a graph arises naturally in a number of interesting applications, there has been no underlying theory to guide the development of efficient search procedures. Moreover, there is no adequate conceptual framework within which the various ad hoc search strategies proposed to date can be compared. This paper describes how heuristic information from the problem domain can be incorporated into a formal mathematical theory of graph searching and demonstrates an optimality property of a class of search strategies.},
