    In this introductory lecture we will discuss the role of machine translation in society, 
    the nature of translation data, and we will also present an overview of the history of MT.

  title: Word alignment models
  instructor: Philip Schulz
  note: 
  abstract: >
    In this session we will discuss the IBM word alignment models 1 and 2. 
    We will view them as constrained mixture models. After motivating the models intuitively, we will develop them formally and devise an EM parameter estimation algorithm for them. 
    We will also try to understand why the resulting optimisation problem contains multiple optima.
