  title: Morphology in machine translation

  note: 
  abstract: "In this lecture we will discover that not all language pairs are created equal. We will discuss some problems that morphologically rich languages pose and how they are approached in machine translation."

  title: Neural models for translation
  instructor: Joost Bastings
  note: 
  abstract: >
    In the last couple of years, deep learning has proven useful in many areas. 
    Also for machine translation, models have been proposed, in some cases reaching state-of-the-art performance. 
    In this lecture we will look at the (now classic) encoder-decoder framework, as well as more recent models.
  background:

    - "Cho et al. 2014. [Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078)"
  further:
    - One problem with the models of the background literature is that they use a single vector to represent the source sentence. [Attention models](http://rxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) address this limitation.
