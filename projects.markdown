We want you to get your hands dirty with most of the core topics covered in the course. 
To that end, we are preparing an interesting project with three milestones. 
See below for description and deadlines.



# Project 1: word alignment (15 April)

First of all, you will implement word alignment models. These models typically produce the alignments used in later stages to extract longer translation units (e.g. phrases, rules).

* Assessment sheet (for instructors): [pdf](resources/project1/assessment-sheet.pdf), [odt](resources/project1/assessment-sheet.odt)

# Project 2: translation (09 May)

You will generate candidate translations in two settings: monotone translation and translation of a set of candidate permutations of the input. 
In this project, you will apply formal tools such as weighted transducers using the OpenFST library.

* Assessment sheet (for instructors): [pdf](resources/project2/assessment-sheet.pdf), [odt](resources/project2/assessment-sheet.odt)


# Project 3: reranking (5 June)

Finally, you will learn the contribution of several rich features in ranking translations according to an external view of translation quality.
This is an application of machine learning methods (e.g. linear models, learning to rank).

Topics:

1. Rich features
2. Tuning
3. Evaluation
