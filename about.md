# Content and other Courses

This course, which builds on NLP I, is about statistical language processing with graphical representations (like trees) as hidden structures underlying the data. 
We will concentrate on Machine Translation as a good example of an application field for a wide set of computational linguistic tasks such as parsing, morphology and semantics. 
We will start with word-level models of MT for inducing alignments; Only touch upon phrase-based models and their techniques, which we completely leave for Applied Language Technology (ALP); Directly move towards hierarchical models with trees, syntax and with modelling word order differences (reordering) between languages as the central challenge. We will also look at inducing semantic representations from multilingual data.

# Format

This is a research-oriented course. A  number of lectures is given by the lecturers and invited speakers. Depending on number of students, the aim is to have students work in pairs on presenting an article indicated by the course organisers:

* prepare a 30min presentation of the article
* present the article to fellow students; lead a discussion on the article
* all students contribute to the discussion about the article for 10-15mins after presentation

# Homework

Read and prepare the articles before the session. 
You are expected to participate in the discussions during the session and prepare questions about the articles. 
You could be questioned about the articles or possibly even asked to sketch some technical aspects of the article on the board, should the need arise.

# Projects

There will be a large project with three milestones: students work in groups (2 to 3 members).

# Grades 

[Weighted geometric mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_geometric_mean) of the grades for presentation (10%) and project work (30%/30%/30%).
