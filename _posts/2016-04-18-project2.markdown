It is a sunny day outside, project 1 is over, and here I am announcing project 2!

In [project 2](../../../../{{ site.projects }}) you will implement a complete translation system, very close to the standard phrase-based SMT approach.
The description is now online, I suggest you read it through carefully a couple of times, than go play with OpenFST, install it, run some examples, and maybe check some of the tutorials.
Finally, try and get to work before the next lab, so that you can bug Philip, Sophie and Milos with all sorts of questions.

See you tomorrow for a lecture on decoding and decision rules.
