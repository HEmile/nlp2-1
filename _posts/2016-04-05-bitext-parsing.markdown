As you know, there has been I slight change of plans. 
I decided to give a detailed lecture on *Bitext Parsing* hoping that you will be more comfortable with it in the future.
The machinery presented in the lecture is really general and will feature frequently in our course.
In general, this goes well beyond MT, being a general and powerful tool to represent discrete distributions over structured objects.

The lecture is now up (and I fixed all typos I could notice/remember), let me know if you find any.
The original topic, which would have been ITGs, will be covered together with hierarchical phrase-based MT, when I will try to catch up with the schedule again.
I will update the syllabus accordingly to make the program consistent with the lectures delivered.

I forgot to tell you, I will not be there on Thursday, but I am leaving a great team to cover for me ;) and I will see you on Tuesday.
