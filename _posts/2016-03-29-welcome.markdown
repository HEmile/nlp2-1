Honestly, we got bored of using Blackboard and decided to host our course page on github (yay!).
Stay tuned for announcements, resources and slides.
Very soon we will update the *reading* and *discussion* sections in the syllabus.

# Lab issue

It seems the lab sessions overlap with some other course. In our introductory lecture it was decided that you (students) will agree on a date which best suits (hopefully) you all. For that a colleague of yours (Maartje) kindly set up a [doodle poll](http://doodle.com/poll/evgxx5sef7583udt).
