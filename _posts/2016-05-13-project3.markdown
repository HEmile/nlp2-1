It is a sunny day outside, project 2 is almost over, and here I am announcing project 3!

In [project 3](../../../../{{ site.projects }}) you will rerank candidate translations using very rich and informative features.
These features are typically hard to integrate in a decoder, that's why you do reranking.
Reranking also gives you the chance to play with some fun machine learning algorithms.

The description is now online, I suggest you read it through carefully a couple of times, then checkout the data and get to work :)

You can always email us if you need to clarify anything.

We will have at least two more lab sessions (19 and 26 May) at the usual time and place.

See you then.
