We have uploaded the test data. In the same folder you will find the gold standard alignments and an evaluation script.
Please make sure to read all the READMEs and contact Philip if you have any questions. The output alignments need
to be in a specific format for the evaluation script to work. You will encounter unknown words in the test set. 
Simply leave them unaligned.

Finally, some of you have pointed out that there are many duplicate lines in the training data. The same will occur in
the test data. The reason is that these are parliament proceedings and you repeatedly get lines like "Applaus!" or 
"The president:". So this is really just a data artifact.
