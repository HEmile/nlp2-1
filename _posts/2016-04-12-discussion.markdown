We have set a new [Doodle poll](http://doodle.com/poll/ap6vu6ztu5c2dkks) for you to bid for papers to be presented at a discussion session.
This time, bid as a team. Express your preferences for at least 2 different dates. We are going to choose one group per date and each group will present only once.
In order to decide, you can check the syllabus for more information about particular papers.

I thought of giving it a try and let you decide/bid according to your preferences. If this fails, we may resort to good and old random draws without replacement from a hat or container of the kind. 

We will be closing the poll on Friday 15 April at 11pm. Spread the word!
