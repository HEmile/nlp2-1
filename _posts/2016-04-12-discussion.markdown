We have set a [Doodle poll](http://doodle.com/poll/r3bz28entsxqf8wx) for you to bid for papers to be presented at a discussion session.
In order to decide, you can check the syllabus for more information about the paper.

I thought of giving it a try and let you decide/bid according to your preferences. If this fails, we may resort to good and old random draws without replacement from a hat or container of the kind. 

We will be closing the poll and assigning the groups on Thursday 14 April 2016. Spread the word!
