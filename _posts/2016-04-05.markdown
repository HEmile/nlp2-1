There is a new slot for the lab sessions. From now on, programming labs will take place from 3.30pm to 5pm every Thursday
(starting from Thur, 7th of April). Until further notice, the location of the lab sessions is Science Park 107, room F1.15.
That is across the street from the Science Park main building 904. You will have to enter the building through the Nikhef
entrance whose address is Science Park 105. 

See you all next Thursday!
