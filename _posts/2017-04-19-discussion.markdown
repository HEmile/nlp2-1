We are going to have discussion sessions mostly on Wednesdays from 12:00 to 12:50.
All of you are expected to read the paper and prepare some questions, some of you are also expected to lead the discussion with a presentation (15 minutes) about the selected paper where you summarise: problem, solution, and findings.
