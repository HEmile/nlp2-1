This is the main page of the NLP2 course offered at the [University of Amsterdam][UvA].

# Content and other Courses

This course, which builds on NLP I, is about statistical language processing with graphical representations (like trees) as hidden structures underlying the data. 
We will concentrate on Machine Translation as a good example of an application field for a wide set of computational linguistic tasks such as parsing, morphology and semantics. 
We will start with word-level models of MT for inducing alignments; Only touch upon phrase-based models and their techniques, which we completely leave for Applied Language Technology (ALP); Directly move towards hierarchical models with trees, syntax and with modelling word order differences (reordering) between languages as the central challenge. We will also look at inducing semantic representations from multilingual data.

# Format

This is a research-oriented course. A  number of lectures is given by the lecturers and invited speakers. Depending on number of students, we will have discussion sessions where students present selected articles to the class.

## Homework

Read and prepare the articles before the session. 
You are expected to participate in the discussions during the session and prepare questions about the articles. 
You could be questioned about the articles or possibly even asked to sketch some technical aspects of the article on the board, should the need arise.

## Discussion sessions

A group (no more than 3 students) selects a paper to be discussed. Then

1. Everyone reads the chosen paper before the session
2. The selected group gives a talk (up to 30 minutes) presenting the work to the rest of the class: you can decide how to organise your talk (whether everyone presents, or just one presents is entirely up to you)
3. Everyone participates in a discussion
4. Everyone (including the team members) submit a short piece of writing (typically a page) about the paper/talk. In this "report" you should summarise the paper (e.g. challenge, technical contributions) and you can also be critical (e.g. about assumptions, experimental setup, conclusions). Ideally, you wil prepare this report before the actual discussion, but obviously the discussion itself might contribute to your understanding of the paper. Thus, you can submit your report until midnight after the discussion.


# Projects

There will be a large project with three milestones: students work in groups (2 to 3 members).

# Grades 

[Weighted geometric mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_geometric_mean) of the grades for presentation (10%) and project work (30%/30%/30%).
