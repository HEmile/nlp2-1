# Preliminaries 

Here is how you should read the information below:

1. `abstract` will give you a hint on what the lecture is about; 
2. `slides` may be available for reference, but do not expect them to mean much without a speaker
3. `background reading` is the stuff we would like you to read before the lecture; this will be available at least a week before the lecture;
4. `further reading` is the stuff we think you should read if you want to master the topic; you should at least inspect the information there before you decide to skip it;
5. in the second half of the course we will have `discussion` sessions, where a pair of students will prepare a presentation about one of the papers we offer; 
6. sometimes we might make `code` and `data` available, then you would also find it here.

Our team dedicates a lot of time to this course, thus we love to come to the lectures and find a team of dedicated students. 
For that reason, we *hate* mobile phones, computers, and other electronics that take your full attention from us (we are that jealous!).
Hence, we ask you not to use those during our meetings.
